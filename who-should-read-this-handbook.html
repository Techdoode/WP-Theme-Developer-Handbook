<h3>The Purpose of This Guide</h3>

The purpose of this guide is to make you a WordPress theme developer. 

<h3>Who should read this guide?</h3>

The Theme Developer Handbook is for anyone desiring a deeper understanding of the inner workings of a WordPress theme.

This includes someone who:

<ul>
	<li>wants to develop a theme from scratch for themeselves or a client</li>
	<li>wants to develop a child theme from an existing theme</li>
	<li>wants to create a new theme from an existing one</li>
	<li>just wants to understand how themes perform their magic</li>

</ul>

<h3>How much experience should I already have?</h3>

To get the most from this handbook, you should have at least a basic understanding of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and PHP.  An understanding of MySQL is also helpful to understanding WordPress, but not really a requirement to develop a theme.

You should also have some experience developing/designing websites using WordPress and an existing theme.

<h3>How in depth will the guide go?</h3>

This handbook provides basic information required to develop WordPress themes, including in-depth information about many template tags and functions.  However, WordPress is such a vast subject, coverage of every possible tag and function is beyond the scope of this handbook.

<h3>Is it a step-by-step guide telling me in great detail how to create a theme?</h3>

Yes!  We will provide step-by-step instructions to build a basic theme that you can later expand upon.
