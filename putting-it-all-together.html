<h3>Overview</h3>

If you're reading the chapters of this manual in order, you've had a good introduction to the components of a theme.  

In this section, we'll put some of these components together to build a simple theme.  

In case you've skipped to this chapter, we've repeated some of the information provided in earlier chapters and provided links to additional information.

<h3>Basic Files</h3>

At an absolute minimum, a valid WordPress theme must have two files:  style.css and index.php.  However, in the interest of flexibility and modular design, you'll want to go beyond the minimum.

We'll build our simple theme with the following set of files:

<ul>
	<li>style.css</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
	<li>header.php</li>
	<li>sidebar.php</li>
	<li>footer.php</li>
</ul>

A more complete list of WordPress template files can be found <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/theme-basics/theme-files/#template-files">here</a>, but this is enough to get us started.

<h3>First Steps</h3>

Before starting to work on the template files, you'll need to set up you're theme's basic <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/theme-basics/theme-files/#theme-folder-and-file-structure">directory structure.</a>


<h3>Doing it in Style - style.css</h3>

<h3>What is the Index Template?</h3>

The Index Template, <code>index.php</code>, along with style.css, is one of two files required by a WordPress theme.  It serves a similar function to index files in a standard website: a repository for the main page markup.  

If the theme has no other template files, WordPress will use index.php for everything.  In more complex websites, this file is the final fallback to render the entire website if it can't find a particular file in the template hierarchy.

While it is possible to put all your markup in <code>index.php</code>, breaking up the main logical sections of the page into separate files allows greater degree of flexibility and modularity.

These files are then included at the appropriate places in <code>index.php</code>.  

Additionally, the Index Template contains <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/theme-basics/the-loop/">The Loop</a>, which is the engine that drives the listing of your Posts.

However this file serves additional functions in WordPress.   Firstly, it is one of  <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/introduction/what-is-a-theme/#required-files" target=""> two required</a> theme files.  Secondly, it serves as a pattern for several optional files.  Lastly, it is the fall-back file in case the optional files are missing.

<h3>Basic Structure</h3>

In the following graphic, you can see the parts of a typical WordPress web page, and which files <code>index.php</code> includes to render them.

<ul>
	<li>header.php</li>
	<li>sidebar.php</li>
	<li>index.php</li>
	<li>footer.php</li>
</ul>

As you can tell from the graphic, the template file naming is logical and self explanatory.

First up, we'll discuss the details of index.php, where all the action (as far as your template is concerned) begins.

<h4>Index Template</h4>

<h5><strong>File Information and Header Include</strong></h5>

The first section of <code>index.php</code> contains information about the file in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc">PHPDoc</a> format.  It is always good practice to comment your code, and this format enables the automatic creation of documentation using a document generator program.  

Immediately following the document information we include <code>header.php</code> using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_header"><code>get_header()</code></a> function.

[php]<?php
/**
 * The main template file
 *
 * This is the most generic template file in a WordPress theme and one
 * of the two required files for a theme (the other being style.css).
 * It is used to display a page when nothing more specific matches a query,
 * e.g., it puts together the home page when no home.php file exists.
 *
 * @link http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy
 *
 * @package Simple Theme
 * @subpackage My Theme
 * @since My Theme 1.0
 */
get_header(); ?>[/php]

The <code>get_header()</code> function calls in (<code>include</code>s) the <code>header.php</code> template file.

Let's take a detour to this file.

<h4>header.php</h4>

The header template file, <code>header.php</code>, includes everything that would appear in top section of a standard HTML page, up to and including the opening body tag.

Here's an example of a basic <code>header.php</code> template file.

[php]
<?php
/**
 * The Header for our theme.
 *
 * Displays all of the <head> section.
 *
 * @package Simple Theme
 */
?><!DOCTYPE html>
<html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>
<head>
	<meta charset="<?php bloginfo( 'charset' ); ?>" />
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
	<title><?php wp_title( '|', true, 'right' ); ?></title>
	<?php wp_head(); ?>
</head>
<body <?php body_class(); ?>>
	<header class="site-header">
	<h1>
	<a href="<?php echo home_url(); ?>">
	<img src="<?php bloginfo('template_directory'); ?>/images/
	logo.jpg" alt=" ">
	</a>
	</h1>
	</header>
[/php]

The file begins with the customary file information in PHPDoc format, followed by the DOCTYPE declaration.  

In the next line you likely noticed an important departure from non-WordPress websites: the use of WordPress PHP functions to replace hard-coded information.

<h4>language_attributes()</h4>



Using WordPress built-in functions rather than hard coding lends flexibility to your them. 

Using the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/language_attributes"><code>language_attributes()</code></a> function in the <code><html></code> tag allows to WordPress to insert the appropriate language and text direction attributes based on the site's <code>wp-config.php</code> file or to use the default, <code>en_US</code>.

<h4>bloginfo()</h4>

In the <code><head></code> section, we use the very useful <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/bloginfo"><code>bloginfo()</code></a> function in a <code><meta></code> tag to insert the charset attribute information.  We say useful, because <code>bloginfo()</code> has over a dozen parameters to choose from.  See the function's <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/bloginfo"><code>Codex</code></a> entry for more information.
