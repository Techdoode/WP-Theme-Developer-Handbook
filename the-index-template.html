<h3>Overview</h3>

In this article, we'll use some of what we've learned so far to build a simple theme.

We'll cover:

<ul>
	<li><code>index.php</code></li>
	<li><code>header.php</code></li>
	<li><code>sidebar.php</code></li>
	<li><code>footer.php</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>What is the Index Template?</h3>

The Index Template, <code>index.php</code>, serves several functions in a WordPress theme.  First, it is one of  <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/introduction/what-is-a-theme/#required-files" target=""> two required</a> theme files.  Secondly, it serves as a pattern for several optional files.  Lastly, it is the fallback file in case the optional files are missing.

While it is possible to get by with just these two files, creating a few additonal files will allow you to take full advantage of the power of WordPress.

The Index Template includes these additional files at the appropriate time.  Additionally, the Index Template contains <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/theme-basics/the-loop/">The Loop</a>, which is the engine that drives the listing of your Posts.

<h3>Basic Structure</h3>

In the following graphic, you can see the parts of a typical WordPress webpage, and which files <code>index.php</code> includes to render them.

<ul>
	<li>header.php</li>
	<li>sidebar.php</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>footer.php</li>
</ul>

Before jumping into the Index Template, let's address the files that will make up our page.

<h4>Index Template Outline</h4>

<h5><strong>File Information and Header Call</strong></h5>

The first section of <code>index.php</code> contains information about the file in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc">PHPDoc</a> format.  It is always good practice to comment your code, and this format enables the automatic creation of documentation using a document generator program.  

Immediately following the document information we include <code>header.php</code> using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_header"><code>get_header()</code></a> function.

[php]<?php
/**
 * The main template file
 *
 * This is the most generic template file in a WordPress theme and one
 * of the two required files for a theme (the other being style.css).
 * It is used to display a page when nothing more specific matches a query,
 * e.g., it puts together the home page when no home.php file exists.
 *
 * @link http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage My_Theme
 * @since My Theme 1.0
 */
get_header(); ?>[/php]




<h4>Header</h4>
As you might have guessed, <code>header.php</code> includes everything that would appear in top section of a standard HTML page, including the up to and including the opening body tag.
<h4>Sidebar</h4>
<h4>Content</h4>
<h4>Footer</h4>
