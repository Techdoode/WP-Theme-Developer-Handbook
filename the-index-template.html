<h3>Overview</h3>

In this article, we'll use some of what we've learned so far to build a simple theme.

We'll cover:

<ul>
	<li><code>index.php</code></li>
	<li><code>header.php</code></li>
	<li><code>sidebar.php</code></li>
	<li><code>footer.php</code></li>
</ul>


<h3>What is the Index Template?</h3>

The Index Template, <code>index.php</code>, along with style.css, is one of two files required by a WordPress theme.  It serves a similar function to index files in a standard website, a repository for the main page markup.  

In the absense of any other files, WordPress uses index.php for everything.  In more complex websites, WordPress uses this file as the final fallback to render the entire website if it can't find a particular template file in the template hierarchy.

While it is possible to put all your markup in <code>index.php</code>, breaking up the main logical sections of the page into separate files allows greater degree of flexibility and modularity.

These files are then included at the appropriate places in <code>index.php</code>.  

Additionally, the Index Template contains <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/theme-basics/the-loop/">The Loop</a>, which is the engine that drives the listing of your Posts.

However this file serves additional functions in WordPress.   Firstly, it is one of  <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/introduction/what-is-a-theme/#required-files" target=""> two required</a> theme files.  Secondly, it serves as a pattern for several optional files.  Lastly, it is the fallback file in case the optional files are missing.




<h3>Basic Structure</h3>

In the following graphic, you can see the parts of a typical WordPress webpage, and which files <code>index.php</code> includes to render them.

<ul>
	<li>header.php</li>
	<li>sidebar.php</li>
	<li></li>
	<li>footer.php</li>
</ul>

<h4>Index Template Outline</h4>

<h5><strong>File Information and Header Include</strong></h5>

The first section of <code>index.php</code> contains information about the file in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPDoc">PHPDoc</a> format.  It is always good practice to comment your code, and this format enables the automatic creation of documentation using a document generator program.  

Immediately following the document information we include <code>header.php</code> using <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_header"><code>get_header()</code></a> function.

[php]<?php
/**
 * The main template file
 *
 * This is the most generic template file in a WordPress theme and one
 * of the two required files for a theme (the other being style.css).
 * It is used to display a page when nothing more specific matches a query,
 * e.g., it puts together the home page when no home.php file exists.
 *
 * @link http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Hierarchy
 *
 * @package WordPress
 * @subpackage My_Theme
 * @since My Theme 1.0
 */
get_header(); ?>[/php]

At this point, you may optionally HTML tags or other coding, or you may jump directly into <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/docs/theme-developer-handbook/theme-basics/the-loop/">The Loop</a>.

<h4>Header</h4>
As you might have guessed, <code>header.php</code> includes everything that would appear in top section of a standard HTML page, including the up to and including the opening body tag.
<h4>Sidebar</h4>
<h4>Content</h4>
<h4>Footer</h4>
